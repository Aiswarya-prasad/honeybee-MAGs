CBM13	CBM13 Modules of approx. 150 residues which always appear as a threefold internal repeat. The only apparent exception to this, xylanase II of Actinomadura sp. FC7 (GenBank U08894), is in fact not completely sequenced. These modules were first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin or agglutinin of Ricinus communis which bind galactose residues. The three-dimensional structure of a plant lectin has been determined and displays a pseudo-threefold symmetry in accord with the observed sequence threefold repeat. These modules have since been found in a number of other proteins of various functions including glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. While in the plant lectins this module binds mannose, binding to xylan has been demonstrated in the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B. Binding to GalNAc has been shown for the corresponding module of GalNAc transferase 4. For the other proteins, the binding specificity of these modules has not been established.

Many three-dimensional structures have been described. The catalytic site is located between the two lobes of the molecules, and a 'flap' structure containing a conserved Tyr residue controls specificity (James, 2004; Hong & Tang, 2004). Several of the peptidases are glycosylated (e.g. cathepsin D, A01.009) and a few are membrane-bound (memapsin-1 and memapsin-2, A01.041 and A01.004, respectively).

The secreted proteins in subfamily A usually have three conserved disulfide bridges, whereas in subfamily B there are six, and the unusual stability of nepenthesin (A01.040) to a wide pH range has been attributed to these disulfide bridges (Takahashi et al., 2005).
